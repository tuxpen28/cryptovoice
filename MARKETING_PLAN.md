# CryptoVoice Marketing Plan

## TL;DR
Target: Crypto freelancers & DAOs who pay in stablecoins but need fiat invoices for tax compliance.
Goal: 100 waitlist signups in 2 weeks, 50 paying users ($9/mo) within 3 months.

---

## 1. Target Audience

### Primary
- **Crypto freelancers** (devs, designers, writers) paid in USDC/USDT/DAI
- **Web3 agencies** managing multiple contractor payments
- **DAO contributors** who receive grants/bounties in tokens

### Secondary
- **Crypto-native small businesses** invoicing clients
- **Accountants/bookkeepers** with crypto-earning clients

### Pain Points
- Manually tracking on-chain payments and matching to invoices
- Converting crypto to fiat amounts at correct exchange rates for tax
- Different tax rules per jurisdiction (EU reverse charge, Kleinunternehmer, etc.)
- Spreadsheet hell / copy-pasting from block explorers

---

## 5. Pricing Strategy

| Plan | Price | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| Free | $0 | Hobbyists, try-before-buy |
| Pro | $9/mo | Active freelancers |
| Team | $29/mo (later) | Agencies, DAOs |

## 6. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Weakness | Our Edge |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Request Finance | Complex, enterprise-focused, expensive | Simple, freelancer-first |
| Gilded | Shut down / pivoted | We exist |
| Coinbooks | Accounting tool, not invoicing | Focused on invoices |
| Manual (Excel/Notion) | Everyone's current "tool" | 10x faster |

**Key differentiator:** We start from on-chain data and work backwards to invoices. Everyone else starts from manual input.
