## Launch Thread (Pin this)

🧵 1/ I've been freelancing in crypto for a while. Getting paid in USDC? Great.

Making invoices for those payments? Absolute pain.

So I built @cryptoslipxyz 👇

---

2/ Here's what happens every time you get paid in crypto:

You receive $5,000 in USDC on Polygon. Nice.

Now you need an invoice with:
- The EUR exchange rate from that specific day
- Client details
- Proper tax format for your country
- A PDF for your accountant

That eats 30 minutes. Per payment.

---

3/ CryptoSlip does this for you.

Paste your wallet address. It scans the chain, finds your transactions, matches them to clients you've set up, and spits out invoices.

Done.

---

4/ It handles the stuff you always forget:

- FX rate from the actual transaction date (not "roughly $1")
- EU VAT reverse charge, German Kleinunternehmer, US 1099
- Works on ETH, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Solana
- Remembers your repeat clients

---

5/ Pricing, because you're going to ask:

💳 Card: $9/mo
⚡ USDC: $7/mo

If you're building for crypto people you should probably accept crypto. So we do. And you save money for it.

---

6/ Early access is open.

First 50 people get that pricing locked in permanently.

If invoicing crypto payments has ever made you want to throw your laptop, this might help.

### Tweet A
Getting paid in crypto: 2 seconds.
Creating the invoice: 45 minutes.

One of these is a problem. We fixed it → cryptoslip.xyz

### Tweet B
Saw someone ask "how do you handle invoices when clients pay in crypto?" on Reddit again.

I got tired of seeing that question so I built the answer.

### Tweet C
Thing your accountant cares about when you get paid in USDC:

- EUR amount (not "approximately")
- Exchange rate from that specific date
- Sequential invoice number
- Your tax ID

CryptoSlip generates all of that from your wallet address.

### Tweet D
We charge $9/mo with card and $7/mo with USDC.

Mostly because it'd be weird to build a crypto invoicing tool that doesn't take crypto.

### Tweet E
Crypto freelancers, real question: how are you doing invoices right now?

A) Spreadsheet I'm ashamed of
B) Google Docs template from 2019
C) Some tool that doesn't get crypto
D) I don't want to talk about it

### Tweet F
Building @cryptoslipxyz in public.

Day 1:
- Landing page: done
- Can take payments: done
- Actual product: building it

Sell first, build second.

### Tweet G
German freelancers getting paid in USDC:

You still need a Rechnung. With a Rechnungsnummer. And your Steuernummer. And the EUR amount based on the ECB rate from that day.

CryptoSlip handles the Kleinunternehmer stuff.

### Tweet H (reply to anyone asking about crypto invoicing)
Built something for exactly this.

Paste your wallet → it pulls transactions → generates invoices with the right FX rates.

$7/mo if you pay in crypto.
