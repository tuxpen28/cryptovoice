## Launch Thread (Pin this)

🧵 1/ I've been freelancing in crypto for years. Getting paid in USDC is great. 

Doing invoices for it? Nightmare.

So I built something. Meet @cryptoslip 👇

---

2/ The problem: You get paid $5,000 in USDC on Polygon. Cool.

Now you need:
- An invoice with the right FX rate on that exact date
- Your client's details filled in
- Tax-compliant format for your country
- A PDF to send your accountant

That's 30 min per payment. Every time.

---

3/ CryptoSlip fixes this.

Paste your wallet address → we scan the chain → match transactions to clients → generate professional invoices.

What used to take hours now takes seconds.

---

4/ And yes — it handles the annoying stuff:

✅ Auto FX conversion at transaction-date rates
✅ EU VAT, German Kleinunternehmer, US 1099, UK HMRC templates  
✅ Multi-chain (ETH, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Solana)
✅ Client auto-detection from recurring addresses
✅ PDF export with your branding

---

5/ We're crypto-native, so naturally:

💳 Pay with card: $9/mo
⚡ Pay with USDC: $7/mo (22% off, forever)

We practice what we preach.

6/ Early access is live now.

First 50 customers get lifetime early adopter pricing.

If you freelance in crypto and invoicing is a pain, this is for you. 🧾⚡

### Tweet A (Pain point)
Freelancer math:

Getting paid in crypto: 2 seconds ✅
Creating the invoice for it: 45 minutes ❌

We fixed the second part → cryptoslip.xyz

### Tweet B (Social proof angle)
"How do you handle invoices when clients pay in crypto?"

Saw this question for the 100th time on Reddit.

So I built the answer: paste your wallet → get invoices.

### Tweet C (Feature highlight)
Your accountant doesn't care that you got paid in USDC on Polygon.

They want a PDF with:
- EUR/USD amount
- Correct date
- Tax ID
- Line items

CryptoSlip generates that from your wallet address automatically.

### Tweet D (Crypto discount)
Hot take: if you're building for crypto users, you should accept crypto.

CryptoSlip is $9/mo with card.
Or $7/mo if you pay in USDC.

Crypto-native users get rewarded. Simple.

### Tweet E (Engagement bait)
Crypto freelancers: how are you handling invoices right now?

A) Excel spreadsheet
B) Google Docs template  
C) Some invoicing tool that doesn't understand crypto
D) I just... don't

### Tweet F (Builder story)
Building in public 🧵

Day 1 of @cryptoslip:
- Landing page: ✅
- Stripe payments: ✅  
- Crypto payments: ✅
- Actual product: 🔨 building

levelsio style. Ship the buy button first, build the product when people pay.

### Tweet G (Specific use case)
German freelancers getting paid in crypto:

You still need a Rechnung with:
- Fortlaufende Rechnungsnummer
- Steuernummer
- Leistungszeitraum
- Nettobetrag in EUR

CryptoSlip generates Kleinunternehmer-compliant invoices from your USDC transactions.

### Tweet H (Quote tweet style — post as reply to any "how to invoice crypto" tweet)
This is exactly why we built CryptoSlip.

Paste wallet → pull transactions → generate tax-compliant invoices.

From $7/mo if you pay in crypto (obviously).
